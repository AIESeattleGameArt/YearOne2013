What I learned:  Learned how to make sure how to sculpt a high detail model in Z-Brush and retopologize, texture, and skin it, and pack UVs between Z-Brush and Maya and how to take the Maya model and bring it into Unity.  I also learned how to create a skeleton, basic rig and pose the character as well as how to correct the skin as it bends.

What I could improve:  Since I chose to do a creature, rather than a humanoid creature with clothing or armor, I think I had an easier time with this assignment, but I think there is still a lot of room to improve.  I think I could improve around the eye area to integrate the eyes better.  I think I could probably get better at placeing points for retopologising as well so that the skin moves better at the end. I also think that I could learn a bit more about UV skinning and packing.  The model skeleton and rig is nowhere near good enough to actually animate beyond a pose, but I think it works well enough for this assignment.  Overall, I enjoyed this assingment quite a bit and I think there is always room to improve and practice.  Making this creature made me think that I should practice more with working with clothing elements.
