What I learned: I learned how to swing at a baseball. As far as animation, I've figured out that
animation is a trial and error process. Starting over is tends to be faster, and you can use 
mistakes from previous attempts to refine your work. 

Predictions on how to improve: If I were to improve this animation, I would try to get video 
showing another angle of the motion to provide more contex. Id also work on the spine a little 
more.
