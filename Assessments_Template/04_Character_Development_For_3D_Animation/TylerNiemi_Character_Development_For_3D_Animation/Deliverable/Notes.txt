What I learned: I learned how to make box moddles into high detailed moddles as well as texturing, the sub tools, different ways to of grouping, retopology, how to make a realistick
eye ball, and appending. 

Predictions on how to improve: I feel like I need to improve more on the face/eye lids for my moddle, as well as the tail. i also need to improve on keepinp better track of my files and organization.
