What I learned: 
-The importance of good topology
-rigging and skinning a character and the challenges of a compact character with short limbs
-clothing is challenging
-normal maps are pretty interesting
-working back and forth with zBrush, Maya and Unity




Predictions on how to improve: 
-Think about how the character and clothing will behave during the skinning process and address those challenges early on. 
-Learn to use shaders
-Figure out how to add softness
