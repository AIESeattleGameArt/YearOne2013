What I learned:

	I have learned that i still have a lot to do to catch up, but that i need to focus more on the 3d ascpect.
 I am able to effeciently able to do 2d art. I have learned however how to use the brushes a bit better,
 how to make a texture map, and how to color the texture.

Predictions on how to improve:

	I need to continue to experiment in zbrush in order to get more experience in using the other
 tools that i havent had time to use enough to learn.
